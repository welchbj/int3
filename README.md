# int3

## Synopsis

`int3` is a Python library and command-line tool for generating, transforming, and encoding shellcode payloads:

```sh
echo -n "int3" | int3 assemble | int3 format
b"\xcc"
```

This library's initial release is focused on Windows 32-bit and 64-bit environments.

## Installation

`int3` is available on PyPI. Install it with your favorite Python packaging manager. For example:

```sh
pip install int3
```

### Environment Setup

#### System Dependencies

The following command will install requisite system dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install cmake qemu-user
```

Please note that this step must precede the Python dependency installation step.

In order to run tests and build some utilities, a suite of cross-compilation toolchains is required. These can be downloaded from [`musl.cc`](https://musl.cc) by invoking the following script (it may take a while):

```sh
./scripts/install_musl_cc_toolchains.sh
```

#### Python Dependencies

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage its Python dependencies. Follow [the Poetry installation instructions](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) for its setup.

You can then install this project's Python dependencies with:

```sh
poetry install
```

### Releases

Assuming [Poetry credentials are properly setup](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#configuring-credentials), publishing to PyPI should be simple:

```sh
poetry publish --build
```

### Debugging

Testing shellcode payloads compatible with the host platform and architecture can be done with GDB (assuming the payload has a breakpoint embdedded within it):

```sh
x=$(mktemp) ; python3 -m int3 payload --payload linux/reverse_shell --strategy CodeSize --bad-bytes "\x41\x42\x43\x00\x01\x02" --format-out Raw > $x ; gdb -ex "handle SIGUSR1 nostop" -ex "run" --args python -m int3 execute --input $x
```
